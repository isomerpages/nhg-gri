<h4><strong>Research Administration Office (RAO)</strong></h4>
<p>The Research Administration Office (RAO) supports all offices and units
under GRI as the key liaison for research finance matters. In addition,
RAO renders other administrative and technology support, such as reporting
cluster's notable research and innovation KPIs/achievements; facilitating
Clinical Trial (CT) related functions with internal and external stakeholders;
serving as Secretariat for strategic committees; and providing technology
support to develop digital solutions to enhance productive and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Translational Research Office (TRO)</strong></h4>
<p>The Translational Research Office (TRO), a part of the Group Research
&amp; Innovation (GRI) in the National Healthcare Group (NHG), facilitates
and supports translational research initiatives and activities at NHG.
TRO works closely with partners within and across the ecosystem, including
the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, to establish joint institutes, programmes,
and projects that leverage the clinical strengths of NHG and complementary
capabilities of our partners. TRO also works with internal and external
stakeholders to support the management of research agreements, internal/joint
grants and funding, as well as intellectual property (IP) developed by
NHG staff. These in turn enable and facilitate the generation of new knowledge
and insights towards better prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management
of diseases, as well as maintenance of health, in alignment with NHGâ€™s
vision and mission.</p>
