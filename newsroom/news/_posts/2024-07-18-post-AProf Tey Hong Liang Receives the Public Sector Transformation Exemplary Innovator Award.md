<p>The award recognises exemplary officers or teams who have injected innovation
in their work, made a real difference to their stakeholders and advocated
the spirit of innovation in their teams and agencies.</p>
<p>A/Prof Tey is a visionary leader and serial innovator. In always putting
his patients first and constantly thinking about how to improve their care
outcomes, he has helped develop 20 ground-breaking skin health products.
Some of these products include a novel dissolvable microneedle patch that
reduces post-surgical scarring and an anti-odour foot spray.</p>
<p>A/Prof Tey shared, "It's an honour to be recognised by this award, but
what's more meaningful is seeing how our work actually translates into
positive real-world outcomes for our patients and population, and helping
them improve their quality of life."</p>
<p>As Clinical Director of NHG's <strong><a href="https://corp.nhg.com.sg/CMTI/Pages/default.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Centre for Medical Technologies and Innovations (CMTi)</a></strong>,
he also inspires his colleagues and fellow clinicians to think creatively,
and shares his insights and contributes to innovation activities in the
cluster. And to fellow colleagues who are thinking about kickstarting their
own innovation projects, A/Prof Tey advised, "Keep looking at the issue
from other angles and think outside of conventional approaches. This includes
learning from people in other industries and how they tackle their issues.‚Äù</p>
