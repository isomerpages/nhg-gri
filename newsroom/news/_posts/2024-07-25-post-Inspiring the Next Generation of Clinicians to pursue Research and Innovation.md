<p>On 13 July 2024, ACSI participated in the annual NHG Career Day to raise
awareness on the resources and opportunities that support research and
innovation within NHG! This was a valuable opportunity for ACSI to interact
with young clinicians ranging from medical students to senior residents.</p>
<p>The ACSI booth highlighted key initiatives designed to support and inspire
the next generation of researchers and innovators. Attendees learned about
the ACSI mentorship framework that facilitates mentor-mentee matching,
outreach and networking events that foster collaborations within the research
and innovation community, and the ACSI recognition awards that celebrates
our talentsâ€™ research and innovation excellence!</p>
<p>The Psychiatry residency programme talk was another highlight, where the
ACSI team had the opportunity to share more about the Academy and its talent
development training programmes with residents and medical students!&nbsp;</p>
