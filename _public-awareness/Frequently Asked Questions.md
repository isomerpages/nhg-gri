<summary>What are the various types of Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions in healthcare. Research studies are
designed to answer some of these questions. The research design varies
with the research question being asked. Some of the more common types of
research are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Interventional research</strong> is designed to determine whether
a new treatment, new combination of drugs, a new device, a new surgical
intervention, or new radiation therapy is safe and effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prevention research</strong> is designed to look for better ways
to prevent disease. These include research on drugs, vitamins, vaccines,
minerals, and lifestyle changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diagnostic research</strong> studies are conducted to find better
tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Screening research</strong> studies test the best way to detect
certain diseases or health conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Epidemiological research</strong> tries to answer health issues
in large groups of people or populations in natural settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Life research</strong> explores ways to improve comfort
and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<summary>What happens during a Research Study?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Research Team, which may include Doctors, Nurses and other healthcare
professionals, will check the health of the Participant at the beginning
of the Research Study and screen the Participant using specific inclusion
/ exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>A Participant who is found to be eligible will be enrolled into the research
study, should he or she consent to participate in the research, and the
research team will perform the research related activities according to
the research protocol. Research Participants might have more tests and
doctor visits than patients who are not participating in the research.</p>

<p>Clinical Research is research conducted in human volunteers to answer
scientific health questions. Clinical Research helps to determine the safety
and effectiveness of experimental drugs or devices. Clinical research is
commonly described as a&nbsp; “Clinical Trial”, “Clinical Study” or an
“Experiment”. Clinical Research is not the same as Clinical Treatment.</p>
