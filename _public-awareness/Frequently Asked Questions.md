<p>Choosing to participate in an research activity is a very important decision.</p>
<p>The following information is written with the aim to help you understand
the issues surrounding research and perhaps address some concerns relating
to participating in research.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to talk to a doctor, family members, or friends about
deciding to join a research study.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. What is Clinical Research?</p>
<p>Clinical research is research conducted in human volunteers to answer
scientific health questions. Clinical research helps to determine the safety
and effectiveness of experimental drugs or devices. Clinical research is
commonly described as a “clinical trial”, “clinical study” or an “experiment”.
Clinical research is not the same as clinical treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Why is Research important?</p>
<p>Research is an essential process in the search for better, faster and
cheaper alternatives to existing treatment and diagnostic options. Research
has the potential to uncover important knowledge that can improve our quality
of life.</p>
<p>3. Why do people participate in a Research study?</p>
<p>There are various reasons why people volunteer to be a Research Participant.
The usual reasons why people participate in a research study are that they
feel they are able to play a more active role in their own health care,
gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available.
Many people also participate in research for an altruistic reason - to
help increase medical knowledge that will help future patients.</p>
<p>4. Who can participate in a Research study?</p>
<p>Each research study has a specific set of criteria to determine who can
participate in the research, known as the eligibility criteria. The factors
that allow someone to participate in research are called "inclusion criteria"
and those that disallow someone from participating are called "exclusion
criteria". These criteria are based on factors such as age, gender, the
disease under study, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.</p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify appropriate
participants and keep them safe. The criteria help ensure that researchers
will be able to answer the research questions they plan to study. Before
joining a research study, a participant is screened using these criteria
to determine whether he or she qualifies for participation in the study.</p>
<p>5. What happens during a Research study?</p>
<p>The research team, which may include doctors, nurses and other health
care professionals, will check the health of the participant at the beginning
of the research study and screen the participant using specific inclusion
/ exclusion criteria. A participant who is found to be eligible will be
enrolled into the research study, should he or she consent to participate
in the research, and the research team will perform the research related
activities according to the research protocol. Research participants might
have more tests and doctor visits than patients who are not participating
in the research.</p>
<p>6. Is it safe to participate in a Research study?</p>
<p>Many people fear that participating in medical research will result in
them taking drugs of unknown dosage or undergo some unproven dangerous
treatments. Some may have concerns where and how the research results may
be used or who will gain access to the results.</p>
<p>The ethical and legal codes that govern medical practice also apply to
research. In addition, there are numerous regulations and guidelines that
have in place safeguards to protect the participants.</p>
<p>NHG has a robust Human Subjects Protection Program to protect the safety
and well-being of research participants. All research studies conducted
in NHG are reviewed by an independent ethics committee called the Domain
Specific Review Board (DSRB). Only research that is approved by the DSRB
can be conducted in NHG. The DSRB is composed of medical doctors, paramedical
staff, statisticians, and lay people who collectively review all research
proposals to ensure that the research is ethical and the rights, safety
and welfare of research participants are protected.</p>
<p>7. What is Informed Consent?</p>
<p>Informed Consent is the process in which the researcher provides adequate
information to a potential participant to assist him or her in making an
informed decision on whether or not to participate in the study. This information
includes details about the study, such as its purpose, duration, required
procedures, potential risks and potential benefits. The participant is
provided with an Informed Consent Form with all these details. The participant
is given the time to think carefully about the study and the opportunity
to ask questions before making a decision. Informed Consent is not a binding
contract, and the participant may withdraw from participating in the research
at any time.</p>
<p>8. What should you consider before participating in the research?</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in a research study, you must find
out as much as possible about the study prior to making a decision whether
or not to participate in the research. Most of this information can be
found in the Informed Consent Form for the study. For example, you may
ask about the following:</p>
<p>Study Details:</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the research study?</p>
<p>What procedures will be followed in this study?</p>
<p>What are your responsibilities in this study?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Medical care:</p>
<p>What is not standard care or experimental in this study?</p>
<p>Who will be in charge of your care?</p>
<p>Would you be able to continue to see your own doctor?</p>
<p>Who to contact if you experience adverse events?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Possible Risks and Benefits:</p>
<p>What are the possible risks and side effects?</p>
<p>What are the possible benefits from participating in the study?</p>
<p>Would it be necessary to practice contraception during the study period?</p>
<p>What are the alternatives to participation?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Costs and Compensation:</p>
<p>What are the costs &amp; extra payments if you participate in the study?</p>
<p>Could you stop participating if you change your mind?</p>
<p>Would there be compensation for research related injury?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other issues:</p>
<p>What are the measures in place to protect confidentiality of your medical
information?</p>
<p>Would you have access to the study treatment after the completion of the
study?</p>
<p>Who is conducting the research study?</p>
<p>9. What are your responsibilities as a volunteer research participant?</p>
<p>As a volunteer research participant, your responsibilities are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To understand the information given and clarify any doubts you may have
before agreeing and giving consent to participate in a research study.</p>
<p>To attend the scheduled medical appointments and take the medication (if
any) as scheduled by the research study.</p>
<p>To inform the research study investigator of any side effects or changes
that you may experience.</p>
<p>To answer any research questionnaire or survey truthfully.</p>
<p>To abide by the rules and regulations stated in the research study procedure.</p>
<p>10. What are the possible benefits of participating in a study?</p>
<p>A research study that is well-designed and well-executed enables the participant
to play an active role in their own health care, gain access to new research
treatments or research drugs before they are approved for use, and help
others by contributing to medical research.</p>
<p>11. What are the possible risks of participating in a research study?</p>
<p>New drugs or procedures may have side effects that are unknown. New drugs
or procedures may also be less effective than current available treatment.
Even if a new drug has benefits, it might not work for you.</p>
<p>12. What is Randomisation?</p>
<p>In some research studies, participants are randomised (equivalent to "tossing
of coin") into treatment groups. In some of these studies, neither the
participant nor the researchers may know what treatment they would receive
during the research study.</p>
<p>13. What happens if I suffer an Adverse Event or an Emergency while participating
in a Research study?</p>
<p>Should you experience any adverse reaction or has an emergency during
a study; you should inform the treating doctor and contact the researchers
immediately.</p>
<p>14. What are the various types of Research?</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions in healthcare. Research studies are
designed to answer some of these questions. The research design varies
with the research question being asked. Some of the more common types of
research are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interventional research is designed to determine whether a new treatment,
new combination of drugs, a new device, a new surgical intervention, or
new radiation therapy is safe and effective.</p>
<p>Prevention research is designed to look for better ways to prevent disease.
These include research on drugs, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, and lifestyle
changes.</p>
<p>Diagnostic research studies are conducted to find better tests or procedures
for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.</p>
<p>Screening research studies test the best way to detect certain diseases
or health conditions.</p>
<p>Epidemiological research tries to answer health issues in large groups
of people or populations in natural settings.</p>
<p>Quality of Life research explores ways to improve comfort and the quality
of life for individuals with a chronic illness.</p>
<p>15. What are the phases of a Clinical Trial?</p>
<p>The process of development of a new drug involves various phases. Before
a drug is study in humans it undergoes extensive pre-clinical testing.
Here is a simple description of the four phases of a clinical trial:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phase I : This first phase is carried out to assess the safety of the
new drug. Only small groups of volunteers (20-80) are recruited for this
phase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phase II : Once a drug is shown to be safe in Phase I testing, it goes
on to phase II trials to test the efficacy. In Phase II, a larger group
(100-300) of patients with the disease is involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phase III : During this phase, the drug efficacy is determined and larger
group of population (1,000-3,000) is recruited. Results from phase III
helps pharmaceutical drugs gain further knowledge on the drug's effectiveness,
benefits and range of possible adverse reactions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phase IV :This phase is also known as the post marketing phase. Phase
IV clinical aim to determine how a particular drug compares to other currently
available drugs especially with regards to long term safety, efficacy and
cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>16. Who sponsors Research?</p>
<p>Research is sponsored or funded by various bodies such as hospitals, foundations,
voluntary groups, and pharmaceutical companies, in addition to government
agencies such as the A* STAR and National Medical Research Council.</p>
<p>17: What are your rights as a volunteer research participant?</p>
<p>As a volunteer research participant, you have the right to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Be informed regarding the nature, purpose, potential risks and benefits
of the study.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Be informed of alternative medical treatments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ask questions regarding the research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Withdraw from the research without penalty or loss of benefits to which
you are otherwise entitled to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Make an informed decision regarding your participation without undue influence,
duress or coercion.</p>
