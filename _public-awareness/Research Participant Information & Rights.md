(NUHS) are accredited by the <strong>Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP)</strong>.</p>
<p>AAHRPP is an established organization that promotes accreditation as a
way to improve the quality of research and protect research participants.</p>
<p>To earn its accreditation, NHG, NUHS and KTPH underwent a rigorous evaluation
process, including a thorough site visit by experts in human research protection.
AAHRPP-accredited organizations also have systems in place to monitor the
well-being of research participants. Research participants can also trust
that the researchers will put their safety and well-being above all else.
To keep its accreditation, the institutions submit annual reports to AAHRPP
